## Introduction

My name is [Edgar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edgar-loves-python/),
and I occasionally write [Medium](https://medium.com/@edgar-loves-python/) articles.
Code related to those articles can be found here.
Each article has a heading in this README.md; gists are linked here,
longer code snippets can be found in designated, homonymous folders.
